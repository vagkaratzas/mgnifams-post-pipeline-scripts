"""Classify the proteins of MGnifams full MSAs by how many copies of the family domain they carry.

Each full-MSA row is one HMMER domain region `MGYP/start-end`, aligned by hmmalign to the family HMM.
Its model span is the first and last match column (`#=GC RF` not ".") holding a residue.
Within one protein, rows in protein order are chained into copies: a row continues the previous
copy when its model span starts later and overlaps the previous row by at most 50% of the shorter
row (one domain split by an insertion, as InterPro's discontinuous domains); otherwise it starts
a new copy. A copy is full length when it spans >= 90% of the model from its first to its last model
position, as a single row is judged (the generation length filter).

Protein classes: single (one row), split (one copy from >= 2 rows), tandem (>= 2 copies, all full),
mixed (full and partial copies), partial_repeat (>= 2 copies, none full).
Row ends follow Pfam's graphics: curved when the match reaches within 5% of the model of position 1 / the last
position (strict 1 / M left every MGnifam 25 end jagged, its rows span 3-275 of 278).
